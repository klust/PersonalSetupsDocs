This is however not the format used for recording on the computer.

This in turn causes problems in postprocessing, as (a) the format is not 16x9 (though this turns out to be fairly easy to compensate in Shotcut) and (b) the interpolating to 1080p is rather time-consuming, making rendering of the videos extremely slow.</p> <p>Solution:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Use an external monitor in 1920x1080, e.g., the ASUS portable displays, and</p> </li> <li> <p>Make that one the primary display.</p> </li> </ul> <p>This does imply that some applications will open on that display, but it turns out that this does not disturb the recording.
