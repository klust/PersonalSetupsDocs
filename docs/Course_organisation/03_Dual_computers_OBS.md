# Broadcast via OBS from a second PC (either Zoom or YouTube/Twitch/...)

## Idea

-   Make it easy for the speaker to use their own laptop.
    An argument for this is that they then have their own ssh keys to show things
    live on the supercomputer.

-   And a director takes care of all work of the broadcast. This may even including
    switching to a room camera view or mixing a slide with the camera view in the corner.


## Option 1: Broadcast to YouTube or a similar OBS-supported service



## Option 2: Broadcast to Zoom
