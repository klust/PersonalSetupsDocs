# Broadcast via OBS from a second PC (either Zoom or YouTube/Twitch/...)

## Idea

-   Make it easy for the speaker to use their own laptop.
    An argument for this is that they then have their own ssh keys to show things
    live on the supercomputer.


## Option 1: Broadcast to YouTube or a similar OBS-supported service



## Option 2: Broadcast to Zoom
