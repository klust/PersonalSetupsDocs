# Broadcast from a single computer with OBS

In this setup, a single computer is used both for the presentation
(and playing prerecorded videos) and broadcast. The broadcast is done 
via OBS instead of Zoom.

Note that we could also send image and sound from OBS to Zoom, but this seems
like a complicated solution...
