# Hybrid course video broadcast

## Direct broadcast on Zoom

### Main problems to expect

-   Get the sound right while being able to swap laptops easily.

    For this reason we have always  connected the microphone to a second laptop
    and broadcast sound from a second laptop.


## Broadcast via OBS from a second PC

### Idea

-   Make it easy for the speaker to use their own laptop.
    An argument for this is that they then have their own ssh keys to show things
    live on the supercomputer.
