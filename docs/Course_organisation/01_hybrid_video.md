# Hybrid course video broadcast

## Direct broadcast on Zoom

### Main problems to expect

-   Get the sound right while being able to swap laptops easily.

    For this reason we have always  connected the microphone to a second laptop
    and broadcast sound from a second laptop.

-   Get sound from videos on Zoom

    Method 1 for this is done when starting the screen sharing.
    In the right column of the screen sharing window (where you select which screen to share),
    you'll see a check box "Share sound" that should be clicked, and there should also be
    a second check box "Optimize for video clip" which may also be useful.

    Method 2 is via the "Audio" settings panel of Zoom. Towards the bottom there is an option
    to automatically connect the audio of the computer when participating to a meeting.



## Broadcast via OBS from a second PC

### Idea

-   Make it easy for the speaker to use their own laptop.
    An argument for this is that they then have their own ssh keys to show things
    live on the supercomputer.
